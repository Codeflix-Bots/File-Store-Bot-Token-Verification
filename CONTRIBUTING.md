# Contributing to FILE-SHARING-BOT
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `MAIN`.
2. If you've added code, please test it.
3. Make sure your code works.
4. Issue that pull request! (develop branch)

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/CodeXBotz/File-Sharing-Bot/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/CodeXBotz/File-Sharing-Bot/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CodeXBotz/File-Sharing-Bot/issues); it's that easy!
